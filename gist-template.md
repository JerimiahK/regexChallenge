# Regex Tutorial
This tutorial is to explain what a Regular Expression, or regex for short is, and how the multiple components of regex's work. By the end of the tutorial, you will have a better understanding of what the components of a regex are, how the regex works, and why we use them.
## Summary
As mentioned above, a regex is short for Regular Expression, and is a sequence of characters that defines a specific search pattern. They are fequently used to validate inputs, and find certain patterns of characters within a string.
In this tutorial, we will be using a regex to match an email address. Below is an example of the regex.

Email: /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/

Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary.
